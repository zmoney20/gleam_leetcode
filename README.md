Wanted to try solving some leetcode problems in gleam to get a feel for functional programming.

```sh
gleam add leetcode@1
```
```gleam
import leetcode

pub fn main() {
  // TODO: An example of the project in use
}
```

Further documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/leetcode>.

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
